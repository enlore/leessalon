              <h2>Six Tips to Ensure a Great First Interview</h2>

                Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a
                member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman's can head off like
                that? Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the
                whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust
                this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were
                some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox
                pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the
                whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those
                traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for
                all that. One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning
                the Hebrew story was this:&mdash;He had one of those quaint
                old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates;
                one of which represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his
                head&mdash;a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the
                Leviathan...

                The Mahar sank now till only the long upper bill and eyes were
                exposed above the surface of the water, and the girl had advanced
                until the end of that repulsive beak was but an inch or two from her
                face, her horror-filled eyes riveted upon those of the reptile. Now
                the water passed above the girl's mouth and nose&mdash;her eyes and
                forehead all that showed&mdash;yet still she walked on after the
                retreating Mahar.  The queen's head slowly disappeared beneath the
                surface and after it went the eyes of her victim&mdash;only a slow
                ripple widened toward the shores to mark

              <h2>As the speaker ceased he turned to leave the apartment by</h2>

              <p><em>9/18/2014</em></p>
              <p>
                As the speaker ceased he turned to leave the apartment by the door
                where I was standing, but I needed to wait no longer; I had heard
                enough to fill my soul with dread, and stealing quietly away I
                returned to the courtyard by the way I had come.  My plan of action
                was formed upon the instant, and crossing the square and the
                bordering avenue upon the opposite side I soon stood within the
                courtyard of Tal Hajus. The brilliantly lighted apartments of the
                first floor told me where first to seek, and advancing to the
                windows I peered within.  I soon discovered that my approach was
                not to be the easy thing I had hoped, for the rear rooms bordering
                the court were filled with warriors and women.
